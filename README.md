# Unscientific-Calculator
In the 788th B3ta Newsletter (https://b3ta.com/newsletter/issue788/), they asked users to make an "Unscientific Calculator"; i.e. you type in a number and it denies global warming or gives you a very dubious theory about the moon landings.

So I made one. The HTML code was taken from https://jsfiddle.net/ndubuisi/fbhckjwe/ and I simply changed it so that clicking a number instead returns "Climate change is a hoax" or something similar.

Update: My calculator did not get into the 789th newsletter :(
